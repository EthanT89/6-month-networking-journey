# Game Utilities (Week 3)

This folder contains the same utility files as `week2/utils/`:
- `player.c/h` - Player management
- `treasure.c/h` - Treasure management
- `buffer_manipulation.c/h` - Binary packing/unpacking
- `time_custom.c/h` - Timing utilities

These utilities are shared between Week 2 (building the game) and Week 3 (testing the game under network conditions).

For detailed documentation, see [../../week2/utils/README.md](../../week2/utils/README.md).

**Note:** In a production codebase, this duplication would be eliminated by using a shared library or symlinks. For this learning project, I kept each week's code self-contained to make it easier to understand and run independently.
